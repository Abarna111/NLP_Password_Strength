# NLP_Password_Strength
An NLP-based machine learning project to predict password strength using TF-IDF features and custom features like password length and lowercase character ratio.

#Project Overview
Weak passwords are one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze passwords and classify them into categories (Weak, Normal, Strong).

We combine:

TF-IDF features from password text

Custom features:

Password length

Ratio of lowercase characters

The model is trained using Logistic Regression and can be extended with other classifiers.

⚙️ Features
Extract text-based features with TF-IDF

Add numerical features like length & lowercase ratio

Train a classification model with scikit-learn

Predict password strength interactively
